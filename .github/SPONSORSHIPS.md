## Sponsorship Limitations

### Project Direction

While sponsorship is greatly appreciated, it does not influence issue prioritization or pull request reviews. If you need to push forward specific work in @santi020k/eslint-config-santi020k more urgently than a general donation can provide, consider contributing engineering time as well.
